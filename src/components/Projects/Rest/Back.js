            A freelance React project in which I worked with a local restaurant to develop a web app for them.
                    I used React for the front-end framework and hosted on Netlify since it was a static page. I worked
                    on it til I met their requirements.    
            </p>
            <p>
            Their local traffic has
                    increased by 5% since the launch of the site. 
            </p>
        </div>
    )
