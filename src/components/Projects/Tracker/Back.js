            A passion project to help people in the calisthenics to track their skills. I had not found
                    a place where there was a decent list of calisthenics skills so I decided to make one. It is loosely based
                    off of a "100 Places to Go Before I Die" map but instead of places I wanted it to be a fun way for atheletes to
                    see how many calisthenics skills they have crossed off.   
            </p>
