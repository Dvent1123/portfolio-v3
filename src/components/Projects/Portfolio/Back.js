            You're looking at it. I made this portfolio to showcase some of the work I've done and to have a single place to
                    reference for projects I am proud of. I made this on the React framework and I have it hosted on Netlify since it
                    is a single page application. I also have the contact form hosted through Netlfiy Forms.
            </p>
        </div>
